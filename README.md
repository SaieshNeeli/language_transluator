# 🌐 Auto Language Translator App

This is a simple Streamlit web app that lets you **translate text from any language into a language of your choice**.  
You just type your text, select the language you want the translation in, and the app will do the rest!

The app **automatically detects the language** of the text you type — you don’t need to select it yourself.
